The concept of digital identity has been evolving in the last decades. Digital identity is the expression and storage of one's identity in digital form, which is a set of claims, i.e., assertions of some truths, made about a person or a thing, also named subject. Despite this, only in recent years privacy, control and ownership over digital identity and personal data are being increasingly recognized as relevant factors by individuals \cite{TheLawsOfIdentity}. 

In this document, a solution has been designed to support a constrained device to create and manage its own digital identity.
