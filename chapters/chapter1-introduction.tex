The concept of digital identity has been evolving in the last decades. Digital identity is the expression and storage of one's identity in digital form, which is a set of claims, i.e., assertions of some truths, made about a person or a thing, also named subject. Despite this, only in recent years privacy, control and ownership over digital identity and personal data are being increasingly recognized as relevant factors by individuals \cite{TheLawsOfIdentity}. 
Since the advent of the Internet, digital identity models have gone through several stages, from centralized identity to federated identity, becoming more user-centric over time until we reach the point where we are talking about Self-Sovereign Identity \cite{ThePathToSSI}.
In the Internet's early days, digital identity issuers and authenticators were centralized authorities. Unfortunately, giving centralized authorities control over a user's digital identity has several drawbacks, a single authority can deny a user's identity or even confirm a false one, so the user has no control over his own identity. Self-sovereign identity is the next development of digital identity and the main idea is that the user must be at the centre of identity management \cite{ThePathToSSI}.


The Internet of Things increasingly involves the collection, processing and transmission of a wide variety of data to services and other devices \cite{wilson2018digital}. Reasonably obvious privacy risks arise from IoT-connected devices when they exchange identifiable information, as this can reveal the activities and behaviours of device users and subtle risks arise when a considerable amount of data is available for analysis and linkage to additional data sets, since user identification or re-identification may happen as a result \cite{wilson2018digital}. For building a digital realm where heterogeneous objects and people interact in a secure manner digital identity, such as self-sovereign identity could be a solution, allowing IoT devices to be unique and distinguishable from one another.


In this document, self-sovereign identity is introduced, as well as keystone enclave, an open-source framework for trusted execution environments based on hardware enclaves. Then is presented the solution, which has been designed to support a constrained device to create and manage its own digital identity.
