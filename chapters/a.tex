This appendix describes how to configure the environment used for testing the proposed solution.
\section{ST board and server test installation}
The code for testing the cryptographic operation has been developed 
\subsection*{Test mbedlts}
Mbed TLS was used for testing RSA and ECDSA cryptographic primitives. Mbed TLS is a C library.  

\subsection*{Test zkp friendly curve }
bbs rust library was used for testing BBS+ signatures that can be used to generate signature proofs of knowledge and selective disclosure zero-knowledge proofs.

 
\section{Keystone and PoC install}

The proof of concept relies on the full Keystone SDK. The easiest way for building and test Keystone and the PoC is to use QEMU. QEMU is an open-source machine emulator.

\code{./quick-start.sh} will clone and build all the necessary components for the PoC to run in Qemu,

$ cp examples/hello ./overlay/root
$ sudo cd ..
