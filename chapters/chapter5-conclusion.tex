In conclusion, this work allows IoT-constrained devices to establish a secure communication channel with the edge device and trusted SSI-related operations computation, which enables to access higher computational performances and more flexible hardware and software requirements. In the future, this opens up new scenarios employing additional and more modern cryptographic primitives for privacy-preserving credentials, which are yet not implemented in the current solution. 
Another future research topic could be the integration of a TLS connection between an external client and the enclave and how securely terminate TLS within the enclave, considering that the untrusted host proxies enclave messages. 
Additionally, another enhancement of the edge device could be the monitoring of the untrusted host integrity with a TPM.
This is just an introductory work to enable and ease the adoption of the Self-Sovereign Identity as a Service paradigm.
